        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People are going to come to this page for information on weightlifting. So, all the information on this site will be focused on workout routines to help guide people working out at the gym for the first time. The main page will be general information about the website. Informing the audience which navigation tools to click based off information they’re looking for. It will give information about the 2nd page which will be focused on workout routines involving upper body workouts, and lower body workouts. It will also give you tips and tricks for working out in the gym at the bottom. 

 The 3rd page will be focused on showing you how each workout is done. It will have picture and video explanations on how to do each workout listed on the page and give any tips or useful information about how to maximize your workout routines. There will also be links to different media sites as well. There will be two pictures and text next to them both. One picture/text will be about workout routines and lead them to the second page. The other image will be a workout being done. This will lead them to the third page. 

There will be a motivational quote somewhere on the top of the page to get the reader motivated to hit the gym.

      </ul>
      <h3>Routines and Training Tricks </h3>
      <p>
        This page will be all about upper and lower body workouts. It will give a brief explanation on upper body workouts and which out of the 3 workout routines to do based off time frame (how long you want the workout to be) and intensity (how hard of a workout you’re looking to do). There will be 3 different workout routines in 3 columns. Under the summary of the page, they will list different workouts under each column focusing on different muscle groups and give how many repetitions and sets to do of each workout. 

For example, column one would look like something like this: 

Bicep Curls 10x3 

Triceps cable pulldowns 10x3  

Lat-pulldown 10x3  

At the bottom of each column there will show estimated time for the entire routine and a very brief reason for why to pick that column and which muscle groups will be trained using that column.  Under the 3 columns will be a tips and tricks section. This is added in because there needs to be information on proper form in general for working out (for example, how to breathe properly while lifting) and there will be a small gym term section to help readers understand gym lingo being used on the page to describe the routines. 
      </p>

        <img src="images/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3837781.png" alt="image for page">

      </ul>
      <h3>Workout Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        This last page will be general information on each workout listed on page 2. This page will either have an image or a video showing how to do the workouts. They will be sectioned off in different ways to make the information less cluttered and easier to navigate for readers.  

        For example, there will be a main 2 section split where you’ll have upper body workouts and the other will be lower body workouts. Under these 2 sections there might be sub sections for different muscle groups. This will depend on how many workouts are listed in the columns on page 2.  under each tab as well there will be alternative workouts for the main ones posted on page 2. This will be there because not everyone will have access to the same equipment at their gyms. Each alternative workout will be stated as direct alternatives to the workouts they are supposed to replace to keep the website easy to read.  
        
        For example, Bench press (image next to it) 
        
                                          or 
        
                                  Dumbbell press (image next to it) 
        
        Lastly at the bottom of this page will be a small paragraph explaining why and when to change up the workout routines. Also, the last paragraph will talk about safety in the gym more specifically what good form is and the dangers of lifting too heavy.
