    <h2>Maylek Arthur</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Maylek, here's a brief introduction about me. 
    I've been working in Grocier management for the last year and a half now. I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree to change careers eventually. 
    I also play the cello and play video games in my freetime.</p>
    <p>Recently I've been getting into a workout routine. My goals are to lose weight while gain muscle and lead a healthier lifestlye. 
    So far it has been going well. I've lost 10 pounds in the last 3 weeks. ALso, I've been doing a lot of cooking and have cut out sodas and 
    fast food out of my life and I feel the best I've felt in years.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping to get a lot out of this course. Since this class teaches us the foundation for web design I'm trying
    to absorb as much information as possible because without a solid foundation everything else comes crashing down.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to be in this class and look forward to learning with everyone!</p>
